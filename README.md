UNIFI Algorithm Laboratory made in Python

# Introduction
This Laboratory work is composed by two parts:

### Same operations on different data structures
I analyzed in Python the (time) cost of the following operations:
- Insert  
- getMaximum  
- extractMaximum  
- IncreaseValue  

on three different data structures:

- Max-Heap  
- Unordered Linked List  
- Ordered Linked List  

Each data structure was initialized with the same number of random values.

### Differences between Selection-Sort and Quick-Sort
I analyzed in a Python Jupyter Notebook the (time) cost of Selection-Sort and Quick-Sort sorting algorithms on an array with the same number of random values.
