# Algorithm Laboratory
 UNIFI Algorithm Laboratory made in Python
#Introduction
 This Laboratory work is composed by two parts:
 ### Same operations on different data structures
 I analized the (time) cost of the following operations:
  - Insert
  - getMaximum
  - extractMaximum
  - IncreaseValue<br>
 on three different data structures:
  - Max-Heap
  - Unordered Linked List
  - Ordered Linked List
 made by the same number of casual values
 
- ### Differences between Selection-Sort and Quick-Sort
I analized on a Python Jupiter Notebook the (time) cost of Selection-Sort and Quick-Sort sorting algorithms on an array made by the same number of casual values
